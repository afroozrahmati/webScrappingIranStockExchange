# webScrappingIranStockExchange
In this web application, I just did a web scrapping to scrap a data from Iran stock Exchange market. The extraction tools are already available on the website but it is time consuming for a user to sit and download a data for all the previous years.

I develop a simple application, (usable at this time maybe), to extract my requirments to evaluate the market for changes.
I think it would be worthy for others to have these code. 

DB Requirment: Sql Server 2016 and above
