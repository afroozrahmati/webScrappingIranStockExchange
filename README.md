In this web application, I just did a web scrapping to scrap a data from Iran stock Exchange market. The extraction tools are already available on the website but it is time consuming for a user to sit and download a data for all the previous years.

I develop a simple application, (usable at this time maybe), to extract my requirements to evaluate the market for changes.
I think it would be worthy for others to have these code. It is on fast development and used only for my own interest. The result can be used for predication algorithm to find out the next move of the market for different shareholders. 

Be aware that I just write these code for testing purpose so you will not see OOP structure properly and DB access seprately. It is just for storing the scrapping data. 

DB Requirement: SQL Server 2016 and above
Code developed in c#.net
